I am an incoming PhD student in EECS at the University of California, Berkeley, where I will be advised by [Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/). I recently completed my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Artificial Intelligence) at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and control theory. I am particularly interested in multi-agent systems, offline RL and safety and robustness in control.

Some of my previous work includes researching offline RL for informative path planning with [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/), optimal dynamic pricing using RL in competitive markets with [Prof. Rachel Kalaimani](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/rachel/) and identifying causal relations between robot actions and human perception with [Prof. Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/). For a comprehensive overview of my research background, please refer to my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
