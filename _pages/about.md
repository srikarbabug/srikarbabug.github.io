I am a senior undergraduate student, majoring in Electrical Engineering (minor in Artificial Intelligence), at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). My academic and research pursuits lie in the amalgamation of reinforcement learning (RL), controls, and robotics. I take special interest in the nuances of multi-agent systems, offline RL, dynamics of human-robot interaction, and safety and robustness in control systems.

Some of my previous work includes researching offline RL for informative path planning with [Prof. Katia Sycara](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/), optimal dynamic pricing using RL in competitive markets with [Prof. Rachel Kalaimani](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/rachel/), and identifying causal relations between robot actions and human perception with [Prof. Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/). Currently, I am continuing my collaboration with Prof. Sycara, where I am exploring multi-agent RL from a game-theoretical perspective. For a comprehensive overview of my research background, please refer to my [CV](CV.pdf).
